    <h3>Intermittent Fasting</h3>
    <p>Looking to get started on your fasting journey? Read about some of the more popular types of fasting suggested by <b><a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a29349587/intermittent-fasting-schedule/">Women's Health Magazine!</a></b></p>

    <h3>Time-Restricted Eating</h3>

    <p>This type of fasting involved eating within a specific time-window. For instance, this means that you would have a 14 hour fasting period, while being able to eat in the remaining 10 hours of your day. According to <b><a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/nutrition-and-healthy-aging/nha170036">this</a></b> study, participants took in 350 fewer calories per day, lost around three percent of their body weight (on average), and had lower blood pressure compared to another group who ate normally. </p>

    <h3>5:2 Diet</h3>

    <p>This form of fasting involves eating normally for five days of the week. The remaining two days, you will eat at a deficit around 500-600 calories per day. It is recommended that women consume 500 calories, while men consume 600 calories. According to this 2021 study by <b><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258853">PLOS ONE</a></b>, people doing the 5:2 diet had just as much weight and fat loss as those who follow more traditional dieting methods.</p>

    <h3>Alternate-Day Fasting</h3>

    <p>True to its name, this form of fasting involves fasting every other day. Alternatively, you can consume a small amount of calories on your fasting days. In a 2017 study by <b><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2623528">JAMA</a></b>, it was found that weight loss was not significantly different (only a .7% difference) than just restricting calories. </p>

    <h3>Eat-Stop-Eat</h3>

    <p>This form of fasting is simple. It involves abstaining from food for 24 hours, and only once or twice a week. If aiming at twice a week, make sure that those days are not consecutive. With longer fasts comes more risks, so read our <a href="Safely.html">How to Fast Safely</a> page for tips on how to mitigate these risks. </p>

    <h3>The Warrior Diet</h3>

    <p>This form of fasting is a stricter form of fasting, involving a four hour eating window at night. During the day, people following this diet <i>may</i> consume small portions of raw fruits and vegetables, while feasting on a paleo-centered meal during the four hour eating window. </p>
