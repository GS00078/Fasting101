    <h3>The Snake Diet</h3>
    <p>Founded by Cole Robinson, The Snake Diet is a unique approach to fasting that is certainly one of the more controversial forms of fasting.</p>

	<h3>Why is it called the Snake Diet?</h3>

    <p>This fasting method is jokingly named after the eating routines of wild animals such as snakes. They eat a large amount of food at once, and then they don't eat for days.</p>

    <h3>What is a Snake Diet?</h3>

    <p>The Snake Diet involves fasting either 48 or 72 hours, and then eating lean meats and vegetables in a 2-4 hour window. After you finish your eating window, the fasting cycle is then repeated.</p>

    <h3>How can I do Snake Diet safely?</h3>

    <p>In order to fast safely on the Snake Diet, it is recommended to consume Robinson's "Snake Juice." Snake Juice is essentially an electrolyte powder that you can make yourself. <br>To make it yourself, you can mix 2 teaspoons of
       NoSalt (for Potassium), one teaspoon of Pink Himalayan Salt (for Sodium), 4 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar with "Mother", and lemon juice for taste. You can mix all of this in one liter of water.</p>

    <h3>So, why highlight this form of fasting?</h3>

    <p>After trying other forms of fasting in order to improve mental clarity and achieve fat loss, I decided to try the Snake Diet, and the results of it were fantastic.
    <br>I went from around 240 lbs to 180 lbs in around 3 months, and the mental energy and clarity that I gained from fasting were very noticeable. 
    <br>In fact, it was during this fast (and most likely a result of it) that I motivated myself to apply at UWG!</p>
