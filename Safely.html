    <h3>How To Fast Safely</h3>
    <p>Wanting to begin your fasting journey, but not sure how to do it safely? Read below to find tips on fasting!</p>

    <h3>Start Slow!</h3>

    <p>Many people give up fasting before they can reap the benefits, simply because they start off too strong. Starting with shorter fasts can allow your body to adjust, allowing you to tackle longer fasts with ease!</p>

    <h3>Stay Hydrated!</h3>

    <p>If you've read the <a href="Risks.html">Risks of Fasting</a> page, then you can see that many of the risks listed can be mitigated by staying properly hydrated. It is <b><a href="https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-much-water-to-drink-when-fasting">recommended</a></b> to drink between 2-3 liters of water per day while fasting.</p>

    <h3>Do Not Overeat!</h3>

    <p><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430851/">The National Library of Medicine</a></b> shows us that breaking a fast with too much food can cause meteorism, which is the accumulation of gas in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This causes many fasters to feel tired and bloated. Instead, just eat normally, instead of trying to make up the lost calories.</p>

    <h3>You Need Electrolytes!</h3>

    <p>Electrolytes are minerals that the body uses that provides plenty of functions. They help regulate fluid balance, muscle function, and chemical reactions in the body! Consuming electrolyte supplment powders that have Magnesium, Sodium, and Potassium can help ensure that the body maintains the electrolytes needed for healthy function.</p>

    <h3>Consult A Medical Professional!</h3>

    <p>Fasting just may not be for you, and that is okay! Before you begin, make sure you consult a medical professional. This especially true if you have the <b><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-fast#TOC_TITLE_HDR_12">following: </a></b><ul> <li>People with a medical condition like heart disease or type 2 diabetes</li> <li>Individuals who are trying to conceive</li> <li>Those who are pregnant or nursing</li> <li>People with underweight</li> <li>Individuals who have experienced an eating disorder</li> <li>Those who have problems with blood sugar regulation</li> <li>People with low blood pressure</li> <li>Individuals taking prescription medications</li> <li>Those with a history of amenorrhea</li> <li>Older adults</li> <li>Adolescents</li> </ul></p>
