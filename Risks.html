    <h3>Risks of Fasting</h3>
    <p>While there are plenty of benefits, fasting <i>does</i> carry some risks and side effects that people need to be aware of. Check them out below!</p>

    <h3>Headaches/Light-headedness</h3>

    <p>According to this study by <b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732631/">The National Library of Medicine</a></b>, people may experience headaches and light-headedness while fasting. These symptoms can be minimized by staying hydrated, managing stress, getting sleep, and consuming electrolytes.</p>

    <h3>Digestive Issues</h3>

    <p><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314618/">The National Library of Medicine</a></b> shows that fasting can cause people to experience symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, and bloating. To lower the effects of these digestive-related symptoms, it is recommended to stay hydrated.</p>

    <h3>Dehydration</h3>

    <p>Another study by <b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836141/">The National Library of Medicine</a></b> shows that fasting can cause dehydration. It does this by the process of natural diuresis, which causes the kidneys to filter too much bodily fluid. This causes the body to release large amounts of salt and water in the urine. This symptom can be minimized by staying hydrated and consuming electrolytes. </p>

    <h3>Sleep Disruption</h3>

    <p>According to the same study by <b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836141/">The National Library of Medicine</a></b>, many people may find sleep disruption to be a symptom they experience while fasting. According to the study, 15% of participants in the study reported sleep disturbances. This includes both being unable to fall asleep and staying asleep.</p>

    <h3>Malnutrition</h3>

    <p>This article by <b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6521152/">The National Library of Medicine</a></b> found that fasting can even cause malnutrition, if not done properly. This is due to people fasting not replenishing their bodies with enough nutrients. Consuming an electrolyte supplement, electrolyte water, or salts is essential to replinishing the sodium in your body to prevent malnutrition.</p>

    <h3>So, to mitigate risks we must maintain sodium and water levels in the body.</h3>
